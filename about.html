        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="extension_name">ProteinTracker</span> can be used to track your
          daily protein intake. You can set a daily goal, then choose the food
          for your meal and for each product add the protein quantity. The
          <span class="chrome_extension">Chrome Extension</span>
          <span class="extension_name">ProteinTracker</span> will notify you
          when the goal which is set is achieved. This can either make you think
          about eating less or even, if you want to get a bigger intake of protein,
          eating more.
        </p>
