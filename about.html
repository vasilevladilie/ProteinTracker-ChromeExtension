      Walk in Progress is a company that aims to provide tools that promote a healthy lifestyle. Our first product is <span class="protein-brand">ProteinTracker</span>. A Chrome Extension available in the Chrome Web Store.

      <span class="protein-brand">ProteinTracker</span> can be used to track your daily protein intake. It allows you to set a daily protein goal and track how much protein you take in. It also notifies you when you achieve your goal. The overall goal is to give you more awareness of your proteins so that you can either eat more (or less) proteins based on your diet.
